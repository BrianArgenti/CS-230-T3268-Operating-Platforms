# CS-230-T3268-Operating-Platforms

Throughout the class a Software Design Document was created, maintained and updated to make a software application for a company aptly named, The Gaming Room. This was a client who had previous success in creating a mobile app for android devices and wanted to create a web app that was a multi-platform game capable of cross communication, no matter the type of OS. The portion of the document I personally feel I did well with was the domain model, developing and expalaining the purpose of the UML Diagram. We used a Singleton Design Pattern to illustrate the elements required to create a single instance of a game session. When it came time to create the code, the UML diagram provided useful direction in the way forward to developing the code. 
If there is a weak point in the document, it would have to be the recommendations. Some unforseen complications arose during that portion of the project and the sense of urgency to getting it done began to create more stress than anticipated. That coupled with the need to press on and complete the rest of the coursework I was not as clear-headed as I could have been and missed reviewing a few things that would have helped me in the recommendations.
